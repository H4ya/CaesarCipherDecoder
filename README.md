# CaesarCipherDecoder
I needed to decode a msg that is encoded by Caesar cipher technic, I coded it so u don't have to! or maybe I'll need it later also:)
Try adding a simple function that detect the character that appeared the most (It's propably 'e'), find the number of skipped char between it and 'e' then automatically use that number for decoding the whole msg
note: it won't work all the time yet it is the first way to decode a msg since ages!. Good luck.
